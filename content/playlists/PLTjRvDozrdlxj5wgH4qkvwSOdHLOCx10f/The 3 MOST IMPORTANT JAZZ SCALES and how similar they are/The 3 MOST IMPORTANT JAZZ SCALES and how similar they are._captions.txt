Title: The 3 MOST IMPORTANT JAZZ SCALES and how similar they are. [Music] hey everyone tony winston here uh following up on a couple of videos that i did that were pretty you know good videos for me you know they they paid the bills for a month or two it was about the diminished scale the altered scale and the lydian dominant scale and i'm going to show you some of the similarities of these scales it's just kind of another way to think about them so if you're using these scales to improve your improvisation you can't learn to improvise just you know by learning these scales and trying to stick them in places you've got to learn to improvise first just using melodies out of your own head the major scale the blues scale you know picking out melodies to songs uh by ear you know is is really the first step in learning to improvise but for those of you that are looking for ways to improve your improvisation these three scales are critical so useful so we're gonna uh take the song green dolphin street and we're gonna focus on the two five ones and so first i'm gonna start off just you know doing c major and then c minor it'd be like dorian which is a major scale it's like the b flat major scale so you know so far you know i'm not using any any you know complicated theory i'm playing c major and you know you could put passing tones [Music] then we get to d i'm going to use lydian dominant we'll talk about it later and then the uh lydian for those those two chords and then we get to our first two five one and we got d minor g7 and you know the melody goes right there i'm on g7 and i started on g and then i went a half step to what would be the flat nine of the chord and the sharp nine of the chord and so that's how the melody of the song goes so i mean if you're improvising you know you can certainly use that idea and let's see what scales that might [Music] suggest all right so all i did was use those two black nodes alright so what scale what scale starts like that there are two that i know of that i can think of offhand one is the diminished scale starts like that also the altered scale starts with the same five notes all right so diminished finishes up with those four notes [Music] and the altered scale uses different notes oh well one different note that instead of both of those so you know the diminished scale has got eight notes so there's one extra note in there compared to most scales so that's altered and this is diminished so you know if you're messing around in this area uh you don't have to think about which scale it is so you're just you can think about the flat nine the sharp nine the third and the tritone or you could call it the the blue note because it's part of the blues scale so all right i used those so i was in diminished uh was altered let me see if i can make a better line than that and you know you can you could start the altered or diminished scale a little ahead of time even on the d it won't sound like it exactly fits but you know that's okay it can rub a little bit all right so that was diminished let me see if i can get a better one here yeah so there you know i did use an altered voicing as well so lots of ways to resolve that uh now let's take a look at lydian dominant lydian dominant starts with the major scale it's got the sharp four in there and then it ends just like the diminished scale so this is like the diminished scale lydian dominant starts this way [Music] diminished starts this way but ends with the same [Music] notes like that so here we go you know was i using uh diminished well up here i was but down here you know it's lydian dominant and so if i combine this part of the altered scale and this part of the lydian dominant scale i get the diminished scale so they're very very uh closely related and you can weave in and out of all of them maybe just be aware of all the notes you can use i don't think the c was in any of them [Music] and the f sharp wasn't in any so so all those notes are kind of available to make a melody out of and not only that the f sharp works as a passing tone and you know the c is obviously not a terrible note either since it's in the g major scale so anyway i just thought that was a kind of an interesting way to look at the uh at the two scales or the three scales and and how they kind of relate to each other on the next two five all right i'm thinking e flat because you know if you're on the two chord of a two five one uh you know it's this you use the scale from the one the e flat scale and it gives you dorian mode and it's just a minor scale basically all right and now on b flat did you notice i'm i'm using the same diminished scale here because there's only three diminished scales there's 12 lydian dominants and 12 altereds but there's only three diminished scales because of the symmetry involved so that same scale will work for g7 e7 d flat seven and b flat seven so it's the same scale now could i use the altered scale the same way no that's kind of the wrong scale i would have to you know go to b flat and play my flat nine my sharp nine my third and then finish out with whole steps like that so do a better one all right and what about lydian dominant there well i've got this see that's part of the lydian dominant and you you recognize it as being part of the diminished scale too the difference is as i come up this way instead of that way which is the diminished scale so the best lines still come from the blues in my opinion [Music] see the blues yeah even here you can make that see that gets the note for the d that gets it for the uh d flat maybe use the more major sounding blues scale this one one other scale that you know i tend not to use as much as my idol art tatum and don't laugh i know i play nothing like art tatum but uh he's the only guy i've been listening to lately uh for the past week or so and i've listened to art tatum when i go to sleep when i wake up in the middle of the night first thing in the morning and now when i listen to any other piano player they sound like an amateur so anyway he uses the chromatic scale a lot too and you know in the diminished scale there's all these little chromatic parts in there i mean if you get going on that diminished scale you know just finishing it out with some chromaticism or something like that works good what i don't like to hear is somebody who improvises with all chromatic stuff you know something like that that that doesn't interest me very much and i do hear that from time to time from like local piano players and there are some good ones here i'm in a big city atlanta but anyway hopefully uh you know this helps give you kind of a another way of looking at these three very important scales the diminished the altered and the lydian dominant and the blues scale okay thanks very much i want to thank my recent patreon subscribers ted carl the psy doc lewis augusto ira and george thanks a lot for contributing my channel i really appreciate it and be back again with you soon what do i've got coming up here i'm going to do something oh yeah i'm going to teach people how to improvise using the blues very important
